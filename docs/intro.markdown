#  Introduction


Flora (**Fl**exible M**o**bile Netwo**r**k Pl**a**tform) is a flexible software-defined 4G LTE/5G system without commodity SIM cards, communication chipsets, or dedicated infrastructure equipment. It currently provides a quick solution to set up a testbed based on OAI and Magma.
It also includes built-in network analytics at both the device and the infrastructure, which provides runtime solutions to both what and why on network behaviors.
